# So, we have some performance issues when playing very high def video.
# But we still want good quality video, and youtube's scaling to 720p is actually quite terrible.
# So we'll try to fetch:
# 1. resolution less than or equal to 1080p with less than 60fps (no 4K nonsense)
# 2. resolution 720p at any fps
# 3. whatever we can get
# And we try to get it via https if we can.
-f "best[height<=1080][fps<60]/best[height=720]/best"

# Save file in current location
-o "./%(uploader)s_%(title)s.%(ext)s"

# Use aria2c for faster (parallel) downloads
--downloader aria2c
--downloader-args '-c -j 3 -x 3 -s 3 -k 1M'

# Get subtitles as well
--all-subs
--embed-subs
